<h3>Anti Banned Features</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those of you who have felt blocked while using another WhatsApp Mod application, then by using WhatsApp Aero you can minimize the risk of being banned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is because the developer of the WhatsApp Mod application has promised that WhatsApp Aero will always follow the latest updates from the official application, including the matter of privacy policy so as to minimize being banned on WhatsApp accounts that use it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Anti Lag Features</h3>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not a few WhatsApp mod applications currently circulating generally use the GBWhatsApp base.</p>
